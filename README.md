# terraform-registry

This is a light weight Terraform Registry, more like a proxy. It currently only supports the `v1.provider` endpoint and
Terraform provider releases hosted on Github.

# how it works

The registry dynamically generates the correct response based on assets found in Github provider releases which conform
to the Terraform asset conventions. There is one additional file required which should be called `signkey.asc`
This file must contain
the [ASCII Armored PGP public key](https://www.terraform.io/docs/registry/providers/publishing.html) which was used to
sign the `..._SHA256SUMS.sig` signature file. If you don't have a PGP key
yet, [you can generate one easily](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/generating-a-new-gpg-key)
.

# use cases

- host your own private Terraform provider registry
- easily release custom builds of providers e.g. releases from your own forks

# deployment

Build a docker image and deploy it to your favorite hosting location

# endpoints

| Endpoint | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `/.well-known/terraform.json` | The service discovery endpoint used by terraform |
| `/v1/providers/:namespace/:type/*` | The `versions` and `download` action endpoints |

# example usage

```terraform
terraform {
    required_providers {
      cloudfoundry = {
        source  = "terraform-registry.us-east.philips-healthsuite.com/philips-forks/cloudfoundry"
        version = "0.12.2-202008131826"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The above assumes a copy of the terraform-registry running at:

https://terraform-registry.us-east.philips-healthsuite.com

It references `philips-forks/cloudfoundry` version `0.12.2-202008131826` which maps to the following Github repository
and release:

https://github.com/philips-forks/terraform-provider-cloudfoundry/releases/tag/v0.12.2-202008131826

Notice the `signkey.asc` which is included in this release. You can
use [Goreleaser](https://goreleaser.com/quick-start/) with
this [.goreleaser.yml](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-scaffolding/blob/master/.goreleaser.yml) template
to create arbitrary releases of providers. The provider pointer also does not include the `terraform-provider-` prefix.
